# deploy-resources
To deploy an AWS S3 bucket and an EC2 instance using Terraform from your GitHub organization's repository with GitHub Actions, you can follow these general steps:

1. Set up Terraform: Ensure you have Terraform installed in your GitHub Actions environment. You can either install it as part of your workflow or use an action that provides Terraform.

2. Configure AWS credentials: You need to provide AWS credentials to Terraform so it can authenticate and interact with AWS services. You can set these credentials as GitHub Secrets and then use them in your GitHub Actions workflow.

3. Write Terraform code: Create Terraform configuration files for creating an S3 bucket and an EC2 instance. Make sure to specify any required configurations such as bucket name, EC2 instance type, etc.

4. Write GitHub Actions workflow: Create a workflow file (e.g., deploy.yml) inside the .github/workflows directory of your repository. This file will define the steps that GitHub Actions will execute when triggered.
